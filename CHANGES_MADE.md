# Changes Made by me

## Added a final Boss

- After all the regular enemies are finished you fight the final boss.
- There are two bosses that are choosen by chance.

## Added a Sword Attack for player

- Since the journey for out player is getting more unsafe, I gave the player a nice sword.

## Health and Mana Potions

- Especailly when fighting the bosses I wanted to have the player drink a potion as one of their abilities, but I have made this its own class called Potions.
- Takes zero mana, but when all the potions are used up then player will get error message(there's 2 mana potions and 2 health potions).
